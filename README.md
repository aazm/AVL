# AVL tree
Finally I have my own implementation of AVL tree. 
Thanks to @JustusMoeller for kicking me off to do that. 

Many thanks to [ponnada](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224095835/http://www.openasthra.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/binary_trees1.c
) for writing working code for printing tree in console. 

To be honest, I've failed two times with this problem... so, yeah, I've appreciate it.
Later, I'm planning to move it from hierarchy, cause, obvious right now it's not a white copy.
